Showstopper:
- Fix bug in resampling (closest slice sometimes seems to get stuck?!)
- Fix exception when entering an invalid input filename

Must have:
- Better output filenames, we probably want it to have the sample position as well as the corresponding z position from the original filenames
- Fix problem with window showing the first slice when moving back and fro in the wizard (sometimes multiple windows get created, and it is possible but undesirable for the user to close that window).

Nice to have:
- Add estimated time till completion when registering
- Add (auto?) crop of the large black border around the actual sample
- ...
